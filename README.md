# PHP-Cache
Caching data in PHP

In some programming languages, caching is used for easy retrival of data for faster program execution, especially programs that connect to database to retrieve data. This project is to easily create, secure, read, validate and terminate cache in php.

**Features**

**Cache Creation :** - _Cache are created with a unique name given to it. No two cache instances can have the same name_<br>
**Cache Path :** - _Cache path can be specified_<br>
**Cache Insert :** - _Insert data in the cache, writes at the end of the file._<br>
**Cache Overwrite :** - _You can choose to overwrite the data stored in the cache with a new data._<br>
**Reading Cache :** - _Cahing data can be read by providing the Cache stream variable<br>
**Cache Delete :**_ -_Cache can be easily deleted_<br>


The encryption used in this project is the openssl() encryption (I hope to find a better encryption algorithm, or y'all can support me with the algorithm)

**Am fairly good in PHP, just a bit above average**
